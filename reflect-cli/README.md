# Steps

Before you run the CLI, you need to install ORAS locally https://github.com/deislabs/oras/releases

To run the CLI, run `npm start ./test user-jellyfish db857f6d-9585-48a6-9028-8c22489079ff` (replace with your own info)

If you want to customize the registry and JF APIs, you can set `REGISTRY_URL` and `API_URL` envvars.
